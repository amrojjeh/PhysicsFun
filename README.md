Physics problems solved using programming

## The Problem
It's been a while, but I took this from Coursera's Physics 101 course taught by Dr. Hafner. If I recall correctly, it was something like:

Suppose an astronaut starts 12 meters away from a wall, and he's moving closer at a speed of 4m/s. He also hits a ball back and forth between him and the wall, with the ball going at the speed of 11m/s. How much distance does the ball travel in total by the time the astronaut hits the wall and can no longer ricochet the ball?

I solved it using good old pencil and paper, but decided to turn it into an app for fun.
